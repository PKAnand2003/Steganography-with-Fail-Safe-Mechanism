# Steganography-with-Fail-Safe-Mechanism
This project offers a robust steganographic tool embedded with an encryption layer and a unique fail-safe feature. By allowing users to encrypt messages within images using passwords, we ensure secure transmission and storage. The fail-safe mechanism, deleting the encrypted image after three unsuccessful decryption attempts or incorrect password entries, acts as an added layer of security, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining data confidentiality.
